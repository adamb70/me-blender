# ME Block Tools for Blender

#### Fork of https://github.com/harag-on-steam/se-blender, see original for more info on the Space Engineers version.

Modelling blocks for [Medieval Engineers](http://www.medievalengineers.com/) is a process that 
involves a lot of intermediary files and manual parametrization. 
This add-on simplifies the steps you need to take to get from a 3D mesh in Blender to 
Medieval Engineer's own `.mwm` mesh-format. To do that

- The add-on provides property panels for all the special data ME stores inside an `.mwm` file directly in Blender.
- You use Blender layers to define the main model, the collision model, mount-points, mirroring-settings,
  level-of-detail models and construction stages.
- The workflow that configures and runs the conversion-tools (Havok, MwmBuilder) for you is customizable
  to suite your needs.

The most current version is available in the
[release section](https://github.com/harag-on-steam/se-blender/releases/latest) on GitHub.

The documentation is published to the project's [Github pages](https://adamb70.github.io/me-blender/).
